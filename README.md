# Embedded System Design Flow on Zynq

## Labs outline

The purpose of the lab exercises of Embedded System Design Flow on Zynq is to walk you through a complete hardware and software processor system design. Each lab will build upon the previous lab. The following diagram represents the completed design of all the labs in this workshop (shown below).

## Source Files Setup

To use the source files for each of the labs in this workshop, you have to clone this repository from Github. For that, do the following:

  If in **Windows**, download [Cmder](http://cmder.net/) or download [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

  If in **Ubuntu (or any Debian distribution)**, install git from the aptitude package manager by running this command in a terminal window:
  ```
  sudo apt-get install git
  ```

  After installing, set up git from [here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).  Then open a new git-bash/cmder/terminal window and run the following command:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/wady100/Embedded-System-Design-Flow-on-Zynq.git
  ```
In the instructions for the labs;

**{sources}** refers to the location where you will get the base files for the labs [here](./sources)

**{labs}** refers to the location which you will use as your workspace for the labs in the workshop

**{labsolutions}** refers to [here](./labsolutions/embedded)

**NOTE**

Board support for the Zybo, PYNQ-Z1 and PYNQ-Z2 are not included in Vivado 2018.2 by default. The relevant files need to be extracted and saved to:

 {Vivado installation}\data\boards\board_files\zynq

These files can be downloaded from [/board_files](./board_files) where this material is hosted.

## Hardware Setup

**Zybo**:  Make sure that the JP7 is set to select USB power, and JP5 is set to JTAG. Make sure that a micro-USB cable is connected to the JTAG PROG connector (next to the power supply connector). Turn ON the power.

**ZedBoard**:  Make sure that two micro-usb cables are used between the PC and the PROG and the UART connectors of the board and that the board is placed in the JTAG mode (MIO6-MIO2 jumpers are in the Dn position). Turn ON the power.

**PYNQ-Z1**:  Connect a micro USB from the board to the PC. Make sure that a jumper is connected to JTAG (between JP4_1 and JP4_2) and another one of them should be connected across the USB pins (between JP5_2 and JP5_3).

**PYNQ-Z2**:  Connect a micro USB from the board to the PC. Make sure that a jumper is connected to JTAG (between JP1_1 and JP1_2) and another one of them should be connected across the USB pins (between J9_2 and J9_3).

## Labs Overview:

### Lab 1

  In this lab, you will use IP Integrator to create a processing system based design consisting of the following :
  *	ARM Cortex A9 core (PS)
  *	UART for serial communication
  *	DDR3 controller for external DDR3_SDRAM memory

### Lab 2
   This lab guides you through the process of extending the processing system you created in the previous lab by adding two GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) IPs.

### Lab 3

  This lab guides you through the process of creating and adding a custom peripheral to a processor system by using the Vivado IP Packager. You will create an AXI4Lite interface peripheral.

  You will extend the Lab 2 hardware design by creating and adding an AXI peripheral (refer to LED_IP in Figure 1) to the system, and connecting it to the LEDs on the Zynq board you are using.  You will use the IP Packager to generate the custom IP.    Next, you will connect the peripheral to the system and add pin location constraints to connect the LED display controller peripheral to the on-board LED display.  Finally, you will add BRAM Controller and BRAM before generating the bitstream.

### Lab 4

  This lab guides you through the process of writing a basic software application.  The software you will develop will write to the LEDs on the Zynq board.  An AXI BRAM controller and associated 8KB BRAM were added in the last lab. The application will be run from the BRAM by modifying the linker script for the project to place the text section of the application in the BRAM.  You will verify that the design operates as expected, by testing in hardware.

  The design was extended at the end of the previous lab to include a memory controller (see Figure 1), and the bitstream should now be available. A basic software application will be developed to access the LEDs on the Zynq boards.  

### Lab 5

   This lab guides you through the process of writing a software application that utilizes the private timer of the CPU.  You will refer to the timer’s API in the SDK to create and debug the software application.  The application you will develop will monitor the dip switch values and increment a count on the LEDs.  The application will exit when the center push button is pressed.

   You will use the hardware design created in lab 4 to use CPU’s private timer (see Figure).  You will develop the code to use it.
